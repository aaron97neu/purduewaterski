      <h2>About the Team</h2>
      <p>We compete in 3-Event collegiate water skiing tournaments through <a href="http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/3event/main.asp" target="_blank">USA Water Ski.</a> We are a part of the South Central Region (SCR). We practice at our lake, Frameswitch, located in Hutto. The team provides the boat and all equipment for team members.</p>

      <h2>3-Event Waterskiing</h2>
      <p>The events consist of slalom, jump, and trick. Competition water ski boats use GPS and software specific to each of the three events to provide precise and consistent pulls allowing for fair scoring  and consistent sets in practice. We field an A team which competes for points which the team is ranked based on, and a B team which competes and is judged at the same tournaments but whose scores don't impact team standing. Most of our skiers move between the two teams based on event, current skill, amount of practice, and other factors. <p>
      <h3>Slalom</h3>
      <img class="event-image" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/slalom-cut-boat.jpg">
      <p>Slalom skiing is performed on a single, narrow water ski. The objective for a slalom skier is to zig zag around all 6 buoys while the boat travels in a straight path through the course. The skier must enter through the entrance gates, round all 6 buoys, and exit through the exit gates for it to be considered a complete pass. Slalom skiing is scored based on boat speed and rope length. As the boat speed increases and rope shortens it becomes increasingly difficult for the skier to complete a pass and they are rewarded with more points.</p> 
      <p>Mens speed ranges from 19MPH to 36MPH (though most men find it challenging to ski below 26 or 24MPH depending on their weight), and womens speeds range from 19MPH to 34MPH. Slalom is performed on a 75' line, though most beginners start at 15' off (60'). The best slalom skiers in the world are able to ski at max speed with line lengths that are actually shorter than the distance between the boat and the buoys (11.5 meters) by leaning their body far over the buoys in their turns. The world record for slalom is 41' off (34' rope).</p>
      <h3>Jump</h3>
      <img class="event-image" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/topher-jump.jpg">
      <p>The objective of jump is simple: travel as far in the air as possible. Skiers approach a ramp that is 5 feet tall on a "long line" (75') rope. Speeds range from a minimum of 24MPH to a maximum of 32MPH. Beginners "plop" and approach the ramp directly and ride over it, traveling at the same speed as the boat. As jumpers gain experience, they begin cutting into the ramp at increasing distances in order to generate more speed. A single cut is a cut from behind the boat into the ramp. A 3/4 cut is a jump from outside the far wake into the ramp. A double cut is a cut which starts outside the wake on the side of the ramp, followed by a hard cut to the outside, followed by a final hard cut into the ramp.<p>
      <p>Jump is performed on large, wide skis that are generally significantly taller than the skier. As skiers become more experienced, they move onto larger skis. The skier is required to wear a padded suit and helmet to provide protection during a fall.</p>
      <p>The best jumpers travel over 60MPH into the ramp and can jump well over 100 feet regularly. The world record is currently held by Freddy Krueger with a jump of an astonishing 312'. The collegiate men's record is 194' (held by Zack Worden) and the women's record is 157' (held by Lauren Morgan).</p>
      <p>Though jump is often the most intimidating event for new members to the sport, it is a fun, rewarding, and safe event that is often the first event new skiers are able to score points in during competitions. Experience, form, timing, and strength all play into a successful jump.</p>
      <h3>Trick</h3>
      <img class="event-image" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/sean-trick.jpg">
      <p>Trick skiing is performed on a short ski in which one foot is placed straight forward in a binding similar to a slalom ski, while the rear foot is placed at an angle in a toe plate. Trick skiers perform a series of gymnastic stunts in the water that are of varying points. Trick skiers can either do "hand tricks" where the handle is held in the hands, or "toehold tricks" where they hold the the rope with a foot. Advanced trick skiers are capable of performing a wide variety of tricks on the water, including flips and complicated aerobatics. Trick skiing requires balance, coordination, gymnastic ability, and precision.</p>

      <h2>Frameswitch</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="five columns">
          <p>Frameswitch is a set of three ski lakes in Hutto, TX. UT uses the lower lake consisting of a slalom course and the jump ramp. We practice several days a week year round weather permitting. In the winter we utilize wetsuits.</p>
          <p>The two routes we recommend taking are 35 to 79 (toll free) or via the 290 and 130 toll roads. It's approximately a 40 minute drive from campus. Look for the gun store on 79 as that's the turn off for the road that leads to the lake. A car is not necessary to be a team member, as members coordinate rides to practices.</p>
          <p>The University of Texas hosts the "Fall Classic" tournament every fall at Frameswitch in which teams from SCR compete.</p>
